    "Estimation statistics is a branch of inferential statistics that deals with the estimation of population parameters based on sample statistics. It involves using sample data to make inferences about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of estimation: point estimation and interval estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point estimation involves using a single value, called the point estimate, to estimate the population parameter of interest. The point estimate is usually calculated from the sample data and is used as a best guess for the true value of the parameter. Common point estimates include the sample mean, sample proportion, and sample variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval estimation involves using a range of values, called the confidence interval, to estimate the population parameter of interest. A confidence interval is constructed from the sample data and is used to provide a range of values within which the true value of the population parameter is likely to fall. The confidence interval is usually expressed as a range of values with an associated level of confidence. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the population mean would be a range of values within which we are 95% confident that the true value of the population mean falls.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, interval estimation provides more information about the population parameter of interest than point estimation, as it provides a range of plausible values for the parameter rather than just a single estimate. However, interval estimation is generally more complex and computationally intensive than point estimation.\n",

    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine if there is enough evidence to reject or fail to reject a proposed explanation or hypothesis about a population based on a sample of data. It involves setting up a null hypothesis, which assumes that there is no significant difference between the observed data and the expected population parameter, and an alternative hypothesis, which assumes that there is a significant difference between the observed data and the expected population parameter. The null hypothesis is tested using a statistical test, and the results are used to determine whether the null hypothesis can be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is used in many areas of research and business to make decisions based on data. For example, a pharmaceutical company might use hypothesis testing to determine whether a new drug is more effective than an existing drug, or a marketing company might use hypothesis testing to determine whether a new advertising campaign is more effective than an old one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of hypothesis testing lies in its ability to provide a structured and objective way to evaluate evidence and draw conclusions based on data. By using hypothesis testing, researchers and analysts can avoid making decisions based on anecdotal evidence or personal biases and can make more informed decisions based on rigorous statistical analysis. Hypothesis testing also provides a framework for making decisions based on uncertainty, which is essential in many areas of research and business where decisions must be made based on incomplete or imperfect information.\n",
